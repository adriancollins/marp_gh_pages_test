# Some thoughts on a better way to communicate

Adrian

---

# What are our constraints?
* We need to create written content
* Technical in nature
* Consumed by many different nationalities, with many different levels of experience
* Need to be able to present or show the content to someone live  as well as publish is for later consumption

<!-- HTML comment recognizes as a presenter note per pages. -->
<!-- You may place multiple comments in a single page. -->

# Where are we today?
* Single desktop publishing systems (Word, Powerpoint, ETC) or NGPS
* Saved in both a shared drive and GitHub 
* Graphics created in both the publishing platform and in 3rd party app (Inkscape)
* Shared review though 3rd party app / PDF

# Benefits of NGPS
* Identical formatting
* Pretty good workflow
* Works well in GIT
* Easy final build

---


# The challenges with NGPS
* Difficult to onboard
* Small number of people left to support
* Difficult to collaborate with (steep learning curve)
* No live preview
* Requires local install
* Slow build time
* Stuck to 4:3 aspect ration
* Difficult conversion to video
* No editor support (spell check, grammar check, highlighting)

---

# Benefits of PowerPoint + Word
* Universal - Easy collab
* Easy onboard
* Encourages collab from outside-team
* We can reuse company content
* Future proof (ish)
* Integrations

---


# Benefits of PowerPoint + Word
* Formatting hell 
* Not built for Git -  No Git workflow 
* Tools cost
* No CMS
* Low maturity
* More time spent on tooling than development
* No automation
* Focused on PDF

---

# What are our goals?
* Platform to create communications quickly and simply
* Modern
* Easy to collaborate
* Easy to build
* Easy to update + report bugs
* Fits into a workflow
* Reliable + Reproducible
* Automate the boring stuff
* Easy to learn - Content not tooling

# Who should we be looking at?
* Tech comms has been through all of this before
  * Many large companies opt for an all in Content Management System (CMS) with languages like DITA and DocBook
  * The main selling point of these is content reuse
  * These are very expensive

# Slide 4
* this is a bullet
